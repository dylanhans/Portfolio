developing a cutting-edge banking platform that empowers users to finance
in-store purchases by seamlessly integrating with their preferred digital
wallets. Split Financial offers flexible, interest-free options for qualified
users, along with the choice for long-term financing.

with swift and various frameworks, this application enables users to divide
payments into manageable installments with minimal to no interest after a short
application that performs a soft credit check and a quantitative model to
evaluate user eligibility through calculating metrics from their retrieved
equifax credit bureau data. The current tech stack is react, tailwind, next.js,
typescript, redux, python, on AWS, integrating google cloud, plaid, dwolla,
appwrite, and firebase auth.

these will change in the near future to the appropriate infrastructure that can
handle banking institution loads and scalability. At this time in the building
stage, users can sign-in through their existing banking institutions using Plaid
for secure transactions and financial privacy.
