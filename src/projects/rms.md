led the team in software design, fabricated UI controls for the mechanical linkage system using C++, microcontrollers, Python with OpenCV, NumPy, SciKit, etc. for computer vision to detect human hand gestures, and manage item retrieval with force sensitive resistors FSR402.

implemented algorithms to direct pressure expenditure, reduced contraction duration to 0.8 seconds, handling 3kg+ payloads with a weight of 750g.

supervised under a Professor, the prototype is to be integrated onto the faculty owned Franka Emika Robotic Arm after placing in the top teams of the Capstone Engineering Competition and may receive further funding or research.
