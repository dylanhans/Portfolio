I implemented the model in Keras and trained it on a dataset of over 400,000
handwritten characters. You can see the results in the web demo below, which
stitches the outputs together onto a canvas. Without any prior knowledge, the
model is able to isolate six of the most important characteristics in human
handwriting.
